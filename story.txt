In a small kingdom, Cinderella's widowed father remarried a woman with two daughters of her own.

Cinderella's father dies, and the stepmother goes bad.

Cinderella's home life goes from bad to worse.

Meanwhile, the King is trying to get his son married. Throws a party. 

Cinderella can go if she finishes her chores. Mice and birds make a dress for her (it's complicated).

Her stepsisters wreck her dress. Cinderella cries. 

Her Fairy Godmother shows up ("where have you been the last few year, for crying out loud?!") and (this is too weird for detail) uses her magic wand to the turn - amongst other things - a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses. (It can happen). Oh, and she fixes the dress and makes glass slippers (early shades of Lady Gaga).

Small catch - this magic power wears off at midnight. 

No problem. Cinderella goes to the ball and the Prince thinks she's pretty awesome.

Dang it! Midnight. Cinderella flees. Drops a glass slipper that doesn't shatter. Chaos. (Spoiler alert): pumpkin doesn't make it.

The Prince then does a medieval police line-up to find the girl who dropped the slipper.

Slapstic. Filler

Now the shoe shatters! Typical.

No problem - Cinderella has the other slipper - and it fits!

Cinderella, Prince, Happily Ever After.
