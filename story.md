#Cinderella Story

A long, long time ago, in a small kingdom far, far away, there lived a girl named Ella. 

Ella's widowed father remarried a woman with two daughters of her own.

Ella died six months after her father remarried. Her father, being a wealthy mad scientist, decided to save Ella. He conducted an experiment on Ella's body to resurrect her. The experiment was partially successfull as Ella did come back to life. However, she came back as a zombie. Her first act on being reanimated was to eat her father. This sad event made Ella feel bad for the rest of her life- one isn't supposed to eat your family members, after all. Ella's stepmother could not stand living with Ella after this and began to treat her badly. Ella's skin was a pasty white due to her zombie status, and she would rub cinders into her skin to darken it, leading the family to distainfully call her Cinderella. Beginning of the whole ["evil stepmother" thing](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/casey-kasem-sad-strange-family-678902). 

Cinderella's home life goes from bad to worse.

Meanwhile, the King is trying to get his son married. Throws a party. Keg-stand!!

Cinderella can go to the party if she finishes her chores. Mice and birds make a dress for her (it's complicated).

Her stepsisters wreck her dress. Cinderella cries. (Oh, and you wouldn't?)

Her Fairy Godmother shows up (And I'm all like, "where have you been the last few year?!") and (this is too weird for detail) uses her magic wand to the turn - amongst other things - a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses (early GMO experimentation FTW!). Oh, and she fixes the dress and makes glass slippers (top that, Lady Gaga).

Small catch - this magic power wears off at midnight. (It can happen). 

No problem. Cinderella goes to the ball and the Prince thinks she's pretty awesome. Everything you were thinking about the Prince at this point is wrong. Maybe.

Dang it! Midnight. Cinderella flees. Loses a glass slipper (that doesn't shatter). Chaos. 

(Spoiler alert): pumpkin doesn't make it.

The King then order a medieval version of a police line-up to find the girl who dropped the slipper. This dude is really focussed on getting his son married.

Slapstick. Filler.

Now the shoe shatters! Typical.

No problem - Cinderella has the other slipper - and it doesn't fit! 

JK - it fits.

Cinderella, Prince, Happily Ever After. 

Prince become King. Obsesses about son not something something.
