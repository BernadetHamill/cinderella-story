#Cinderella Story

A long, long time ago, in a small kingdom far, far away, there lived a girl named Cinderella. 

Cinderella's widowed father remarried a woman with two daughters of her own.

Cinderella's father dies, and the stepmother goes bad. Beginning of the whole ["evil stepmother" thing](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/casey-kasem-sad-strange-family-678902). 

Cinderella's home life goes from bad to worse.

Meanwhile, the King is trying to get his son married. Throws a party. 

Cinderella can go to the party if she finishes her chores. Mice and birds make a dress for her (it's complicated).

Her stepsisters wreck her dress. Cinderella cries. (Oh, and you wouldn't?)

Her Fairy Godmother shows up (And I'm all like, "where have you been the last few year?!") and (this is too weird for detail) uses her magic wand to the turn - amongst other things - a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses (early GMO experimentation FTW!). Oh, and she fixes the dress and makes glass slippers (top that, Lady Gaga).

Small catch - this magic power wears off at midnight. (It can happen). 

No problem. Cinderella goes to the ball and the Prince thinks she's pretty awesome.

Dang it! Midnight. Cinderella flees. Drops a glass slipper (that doesn't shatter). Chaos. (Spoiler alert): pumpkin doesn't make it.

The King then order a medieval police line-up to find the girl who dropped the slipper.

Slapstic. Filler

Now the shoe shatters! Typical.

No problem - Cinderella has the other slipper - and it doesn't fit! JK - it fits.

Cinderella, Prince, Happily Ever After.
